A Beginner's Path to Linux Audio

In this project I try to document my path building an audio production setup on Linux, to save the lessons I learn for myself so that I can repeat the steps later, but also to share tips to others who might be trying to do something similar.

## Background
I've used Reaper DAW on Windows for around 10 years now. But most of that time has been quite passive. I have recoreded two releases with it, so I'm quite familiar with Reaper, but would still count my self a beginner in audio production. I have mostly used Windows, but sometimes also used Linux, though not for audio production.

Now that support for Windows 10 is ending, and there's no realistic upgrade path for my hardware to support Windows 11 I'm trying to turn to Linux.

My goal is to setup an audio production system on Linux using my existing now obsolete hardware, with which I can continue playing and recording guitar, bass and keyboards.
